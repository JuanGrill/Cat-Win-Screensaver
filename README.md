## About:
- So, when you stay idle for too long in Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion, a red skull (Specimen 9) rushes towards you. Then, a scrensaver animation plays where a Windows-inspired dialog box that looks like a cat starts moving around the screen like the well-known DVD screensaver.
If you try to move or do anything else at this point, a cutscene will play where the red skull causes you a game over.
- This screensaver tries to replicate this particular in-game behavior (Specimen 9 not included).
